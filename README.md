## Industrial Copper Modeling

### Description: ##
This approach outlines a comprehensive data preprocessing, exploration, feature engineering, and model building pipeline, followed by the creation of an interactive model GUI using Streamlit for predictive analysis and interpretation, enhancing the ML workflow efficiency and user experience. Additionally, it emphasizes model interpretability and scalability through techniques like hyperparameter optimization and pickling for model persistence.

## Introduction: ##
Utilizing supervised learning techniques, this project aims to predict the selling price through regression modeling and determine the status via classification modeling, facilitated by a Streamlit interface for user-friendly access to price and status predictions.
